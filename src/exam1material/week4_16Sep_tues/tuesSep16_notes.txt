HW 3 due tonight - don't add parentheses


Problem 6:


p ∨ q ∨ r |- r ∨ q ∨ p

vs

p ∨ (q ∨ r)

no new homework this week

Exam 1 is Thursday, September 18

////////////////////////////////

Today:
- Proof of distributive law
- Implies elimination
- Exam 1 review

////////////////////////////////

OrE is one of the open ended problems on the exam.
Implies operator is also going to be one of the open ended probelms on the exam.

Proving two statements are equivalent with deduction?


statement1
statement2






////////////////////////////////

Example: prove one of the distributive laws

p ∨ (q ∧ r)     is equivalent to       (p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨ r)


(orDist1.sc and orDist2.sc)



////////////////////////////////

if (extraCredit == true || grade < 90) {
    if (extraCredit == true || grade >= 80) {
        //do stuff
    }
}


--> how does the distributive law tell us we can rewrite 
    this?


////////////////////////////////

Implies-elimination, ImplyE

          P, P → Q
ImplyE: -----------
            Q



(This rule is also called "modus ponens")

Example:

//Suppose we know x > 5. What can we conclude?

if (x > 5) {
    y = 17;
}

///////////////////////////////

Syntax for using ImplyE:

a ( P       )   by Justification,
b ( P → Q   )   by Justification,
c ( Q       )   by ImplyE(b, a)

__>:

////////////////////////////////////////

Example (imply1.sc):

(p ∧ q) → r,  p → q,  p  ⊢ r



Example (imply2.logika):

p → r,  q → r,  p ∨ q  ⊢ r

How to prove two propositional logic statements are 
equivalent?

    Approach 1: Build a truth table (2 of them) and for each truth assignment, they have the same output

    Approach 2: Deduction (2 of them). Statement 1 as the premise and Statement 2 as the conclusion.




How to prove propositional logic statements are 
NOT equivalent?

Find ONE counterexample (a truth assignment) where the two statements have different output
CANNOT use deduction to prove they aren't equivalent.


What is satisfiability? 
There exist at least one trutyh assignment that makes the statement output true
ARE satisfiable: Contingent  (some true / false) and Tautology (all true)
NOT satisfiable: Contradictory (all false)

Prove satisfiability: Only need ONE truth assignment
Prove NOT satisfiable: Full truth table and should be contradictory


- Determining whether an argument is valid or invalid
    (what is an argument?)
    Premise, Conclusion
    valid: Every time all premises are true, then the conclusion is also true

    how prove valid?
    1) Make a "combined" truth table, make sure every truth 
    assignmentthat makes all premises true also makes the conclusion true

    2) Deduction

    how prove invalid?
    Find one truth assignment that makes all premises true 
    but the conclusion false


/////////////////////////////////////////

Closed notes/computers.


Mix of multiple choice (like quizzes) and open-ended (like homework)

Some problems will ask for a proof or explanation --
    read carefully!
